Docker Course
=============

The Docker course consists of a 1.5-hour long video (**Youtube**), as well as eight workbooks (**Learn the Part**). After you finish the course on Youtube, it is highly recommended to complete the workbooks on this platform. Every workbook allows you to practice and further reinforce the material that you learned from a specific chapter.
