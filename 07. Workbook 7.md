# Docker Compose

Workbook 7, rooted in the teachings of Chapter 9 of the Docker Course, focuses on simplifying your development workflow using Docker Compose. This workbook will guide you through filling out a `docker-compose.yml` file to efficiently manage multiple containers â€“ specifically, a PostgreSQL container and a Flask application container. Should you find any task challenging, it is advised to revisit **Chapter 9** ([57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s69slvfVp0I&t=3446s&ab_channel=RayanSlim)).

## **Getting Started**

The starter project from the previous workbook contains a docker-compose template. Familiarize yourself with the provided template, which outlines the structure for defining two services.

## **Configure the PostgreSQL and Flask Service**

- Under the **`postgresql`** service:
    - Set **`image`** to **`postgres:14`**.
    - Define **`environment`** variables for PostgreSQL (e.g., **`POSTGRES_DB`**, **`POSTGRES_USER`**, **`POSTGRES_PASSWORD`**).
    - Set **`ports`** to map the container port to a machine port, such as **`5432:5432`**.
- Under the **`flaskapp`** service:
    - Set **`image`** to the name of your Flask app image (e.g., **`flaskapp:latest`**).
    - Use **`depends_on`** to ensure it starts after the **`postgresql`** service.
    - Define necessary **`environment`** variables for your Flask application.
    - Map the Flask application's port in **`ports`** (e.g., **`3000:3000`**).

## **Running each Service with Docker Compose**

Execute **`docker compose up`** to start both the PostgreSQL and Flask services. Docker Compose will handle the creation and startup sequence based on your configuration.

## **Expected Output**

Check that the Flask application is accessible at **`localhost:3000`** (or the port that you chose) and successfully connects to the PostgreSQL database.

## Shutting Down

Use docker compose down to stop and remove the containers created by docker compose up.

## Reflection

Reflect on the convenience and efficiency of using Docker Compose for managing multiple services.

## Clean Up

Clean your Docker environment as necessary.
