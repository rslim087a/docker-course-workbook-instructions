# Docker Volumes

Workbook 8, building on concepts from Chapter 10, focuses on connecting a PostgreSQL database to a persistent volume using Docker. This ensures data longevity even when containers are destroyed and rebuilt. Should you find any task challenging, it is advised to revisit **Chapter 10** ([01:09:02](https://youtu.be/s69slvfVp0I?t=4144)).

## **Launch the Starter Code**

From inside of **`workbooks`**, launch  **`06-starter-code`**.

## **Initial Setup without Persistent Volumes**

The first step is run both services using the provided **docker-compose.yml** file (make sure to comment out the volume fields). Observe how data is lost after the container is stopped and restarted.

## **Configure Persistent Volumes**

The default behavior of PostgreSQL is to save its data inside of /var/lib/postgresql/data. So define a named volume (e.g., inventory-db) and mount it to /var/lib/postgresql/data.

## **Re-run the Application with Persistent Data**

1. Execute **`docker compose up`** again, this time with the volume configured.
2. Submit data and then stop the container (**`docker compose down`**).
3. Restart the container (**`docker compose up`**) and observe that the previously submitted data persist.

## **Final Cleanup**

Clean your Docker environment, including volumes.
