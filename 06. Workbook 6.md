# Running PostgreSQL in Docker

Workbook 6, building on Chapter 8 of the Docker Course, reinforces the ease with which a cumbersome software like PostgreSQL can be run in a docker container. Should you find any task challenging, revisit **Chapter 8** ([49:34](https://youtu.be/s69slvfVp0I?t=2976)).

## **Pull the Image**

Docker Hub provides a pre-configured image named postgres:14. This image allows you to run an isolated PostgreSQL instance in a container. Pull the image using **`docker pull postgres:14`**.

## Create a Container

The PostgreSQL application relies on the environment variables POSTGRES_DB POSTGRES_USER POSTGRES_PASSWORD to set the **database name**, **user**, and **password**. The PostgreSQL application also runs on port 5432. Use this information to create a container that passes these variables to its underlying PostgreSQL application, and maps the container port to a port on your machine.

## Testing the Connection

Refresh your Python application. Assuming the correct variables were provided, it should successfully connect to your running instance of PostgreSQL.

## Clean Up

Deletes all images and stopped containers.
