# Running a Docker Container

This workbook will enhance your understanding of Chapter 3 from the Docker Course. Should you find any task challenging, it's advisable to review the chapter again ([08:03](https://youtu.be/s69slvfVp0I?t=484)) for a better grasp of the concepts.

## **Did you download the resources?**

If you did not download the resources yet, please revisit Chapter 1 ([03:58](https://youtu.be/s69slvfVp0I?t=238)).

## **Launch the Starter Code**

Inside of **`workbooks`**, open the folder **`01-starter-code`**.

## **Prepare Your Docker Environment:**

Ensure your Docker environment is up and running. If needed, revisit the setup instructions in Chapter 2 ([05:12](https://youtu.be/s69slvfVp0I?t=312)).

## **Pull Java Docker Image**

Workbook 1 contains a Java application that was packaged into a JAR file, which requires a Java environment in order to run. Just like you did with the Python image, you can pull the official Java Docker Image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). There, search for the `opendjk` image. The default command seen on the landing page will pull the latest version of the image.

You need to declare a tag in order to pull a specific version of the image (docker pull **image**:**tag)**. Navigate to the Tags section, and search for 11-jre-slim.

The image tagged 11-jre-slim contains a slimmed-down version of Java 11. Copy the command into your terminal and pull the image into your docker engine.

## **Verify Image Download**

Use the command docker images to view the list of images and verify the presence of the Java image.

## **Locate Your Java Application**

Find the path to `JavaApp.jar` on your computer. If you are unsure, refer back to Chapter 3 ([08:03](https://youtu.be/s69slvfVp0I?t=484))

## **Create and Run Java Docker Container:**

Use the docker run command to create a container that:

- mounts the **JavaApp.jar** file from your system into the container using the `v` flag.
- leverages the pre-configured Java environment that we pulled from Docker Hub.
- uses the command **java -cp /path/in/container/JavaApp.jar JavaApp** to execute the JAR file.

Should you struggle with this task, refer back to Chapter 3 ([08:03](https://youtu.be/s69slvfVp0I?t=484))

## **Application Output**

```
»:     ____.  _________   _________
»:    |    | /  _  \   \ /   /  _  \
»:    |    |/  /_\  \   Y   /  /_\  \
»: /\__|    /    |    \     /    |    \
»: \________\____|__  /\___/\____|__  /
»:                  \/              \/

```

## **Clean Up**

Clean your Docker environment by deleting images and stopped containers.
