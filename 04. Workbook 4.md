# Publishing a Docker Image to Docker Hub

Workbook 4, based on Chapter 6 of the Docker Course, walks you through the process of building your Docker image and pushing it to Docker Hub. This enables others to access and run your application easily. The workbook will culminate in pulling your own image from Docker Hub to run the application. Should you find any task challenging, it's advisable to review **Chapter 6** ([35:53](https://youtu.be/s69slvfVp0I?t=2155)).

## **Did you download the resources?**

If you did not download the resources yet, please revisit Chapter 1 ([03:58](https://youtu.be/s69slvfVp0I?t=238)).

## **Launch the Starter Code**

From inside of **`workbooks`**, launch **`04-starter-code`**.

## **Review the Dockerfile**

Start by reviewing the provided Dockerfile for the global-superstore project. Ensure you understand each command's purpose in the image creation process. In summary:

- The Dockerfile uses maven:3.6.3-jdk-11-slim as the base image. This is suitable for Java applications built with Maven.
- The working directory is set to /usr/src/. All project files will be copied to and run from this directory in the container.
- The COPY command transfers the global-superstore project files from your local system into the Docker container's working directory.
- The EXPOSE command is used to inform that the application uses port 8080.
- The CMD command is set to run mvn clean spring-boot:run, which starts the Spring Boot application and installs missing dependencies.

## **Build the Docker Image**

Build your Docker image using docker build -t yourusername/global-superstore:tag . Replace yourusername with your Docker Hub username and tag with your preferred version tag.

## **Verify the Image Creation**

Use docker images to confirm that your new image is listed.

## **Push the Image to Docker Hub**

Ensure you are logged into your Docker Hub account using `docker login`. Then, push the image using `docker push yourusername/global-superstore:tag`.

## **Pull and Run Your Image**

To test, pull your image from Docker Hub using `docker pull yourusername/global-superstore:tag`, and run the container using `docker run -p 8080:8080 yourusername/global-superstore:tag`.

## **Access the Application**

Navigate to **localhost:8080** in your browser to access the global superstore application.

## **Reflection**

Reflect on the process of sharing your application via Docker Hub and the ease of deployment it offers to users globally.

## **Clean Up**

Clean your Docker environment by deleting images and stopped containers.
