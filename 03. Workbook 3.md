# **Building a Docker Image with a Dockerfile**

This workbook builds upon Chapter 4 of the Docker Course, focusing on using a Dockerfile to create a custom Docker image for your Java application. Should you find any task challenging, it's advisable to review the chapter again ([17:18](https://youtu.be/s69slvfVp0I?t=1038)) for a better grasp of the concepts.

## **Did you download the resources?**

If you did not download the resources yet, please revisit Chapter 1 (timestamp [03:58](https://youtu.be/s69slvfVp0I?t=238)).

## **Launch the Starter Code**

From inside of **`workbooks`**, launch **`02-starter-code`**.

## **Review the Dockerfile**

Open the provided Dockerfile. It contains comments guiding you through various steps of image creation.

Review each comment and understand its purpose:

1. Base image selection
2. Setting the working directory
3. Copying the source code
4. Defining the startup command

## **Select the Base Image**

As per the Dockerfile comment, choose an appropriate base image for the Java environment. You may use **`openjdk:11-jre-slim`** or any other version suitable for **`JavaApp.jar`**.

## **Set the Working Directory**

Define the working directory in the container where the `JavaApp.jar` will be placed and executed.

## **Copy JavaApp.jar**

Use the COPY command in the Dockerfile to copy **`JavaApp.jar`** from your local file system to the container's working directory.

## D**efine the Command**

Provide the container with a startup command to execute the Java application: **`java -cp JavaApp.jar JavaApp`**.

## **Build the Docker Image**

Use the **`docker build`** command to build your Docker image. Remember to tag it appropriately for easy identification. Here are some examples:

- **`docker build -t javaapp:0.0.1 .`**
- **`docker build -t javaapp:0.0.2 .`**
- **`docker build -t javaapp:latest .`**

## **Verify the Image Creation**

After building, verify that your new Docker image is listed by running **`docker images`**.

## **Run the Container**

Use **`docker run`** to create a container from your new image and observe the application's execution.

## **Application Output**

```
»:     ____.  _________   _________
»:    |    | /  _  \   \ /   /  _  \
»:    |    |/  /_\  \   Y   /  /_\  \
»: /\__|    /    |    \     /    |    \
»: \________\____|__  /\___/\____|__  /
»:                  \/              \/

```

## **Reflection**

Reflect on the process of using a Dockerfile to create a custom image and how it compares to the direct **`docker run`** method from Chapter 3.

## Clean Up

Clean your Docker environment by deleting images and stopped containers.
