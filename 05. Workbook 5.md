# Environment Variables

Workbook 5, building on Chapters 7 of the Docker Course, guides you in deploying a Flask application that relies on environment variables in order to connect to an external database. Should you find any task challenging, revisit **Chapter 7** ([42:03](https://youtu.be/s69slvfVp0I?t=2522)).

## **Did you download the resources?**

If you did not download the resources yet, please revisit Chapter 1 ([03:58](https://youtu.be/s69slvfVp0I?t=238)).

## **Launch the Starter Code**

From inside of **`workbooks`**, launch **`05-starter-code`**.

## **Understanding Environment Variables**

Recognize that environment variables are key to keeping sensitive data like database credentials out of your codebase and adaptable to different environments.

## **Review the Flask Application Code**

Examine the provided Python Flask application code to see which environment variables it relies on to configure a PostgreSQL connection.

## **Examine the Dockerfile**

Ensure your Dockerfile is prepared for the Flask application.

## **Build the Docker Image**

Build the Docker image for your Flask application.

## **Run the Container with Environment Variables**

Run the Docker container, passing in environment variables for the database connection.

## **Test the Application**

Access the application by navigating to `localhost:3000`. It should output a message that says: ***“Failed to connect to an instance of PostgreSQL. You are using the env variables: <Your connection details>”***

## **Reflection**

Reflect on how environment variables enhance the configurability of your containerized applications.

## **Clean Up**

Clean your Docker environment by deleting images and stopped containers.
